# Maze Game

- Algorithm: perfect maze algorithm was used
- Generate at which ever size you want (although keeping it under 50 x 50 will probably save you time)
- Play the maze: You can 'start game' to play a generated game. There, you can look around with the mouse and move with WASD, in the goal to find a shining yellow ball placed somewhere in the maze
- Colorful mazes: If you click on 'generate maze' a couple of times, you will see it will have different colors
- See teh generation: As you generate a maze, you can see how it is being generated
