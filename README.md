See the feature implement below: 
User story 1: As a developer, I want to generate a perfect maze, so that I can showcase my
technical capabilities.
- I want to implement a perfect maze generation algorithm. ✔️
- I want the algorithm implementation to create a visual representation. ✔️
 
User story 2: As a user, I want to be able to configure the maze, so that I can control its
visual representation.
- I want to be able to set the width of the maze in the user interface. ✔️
- I want to be able to set the height of the maze in the user interface. ✔️

- I want to be able to (re)generate the maze at any time. ✔️
- I want to be able to see the maze in its entirety. ✔️

User story 3: As a user, I want to generate mazes of varying sizes, so I have a better view of
the algorithm's visual representation.
- I want to be able to configure the maze’s size to a maximum of 250x250 cells. ✔️
- I want to be able to configure the maze’s width and height to at least 10x10 in size. ✔️
- I want to be able to generate a maze without significant impact on performance. ✔️

User story 4: As a user, I want a responsive user interface, so that I can view the maze on 
multiple device resolutions.
- I want the user interface to look good on Desktop (1920x1080). ✔️
- I want the user interface to look good on iPad (2048x1536). ✔️
- I want the user interface to look good on iPhoneX (2436x1125). ✔️

## Optional features
